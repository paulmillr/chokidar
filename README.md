# Chokidar
A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile.

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on mac.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like TextMate2 on mac.
* Sometimes report events twice.
* Has only one non-useful event: `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as shitty in event tracking.

Chokidar resolves this problems.

It is used in
[brunch](http://brunch.io),
[socketstream](http://www.socketstream.org),
and [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io)
and had proven itself in production env.

## Getting started
Install chokidar via node.js package manager:

    npm install chokidar

Then just require the package in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

var watcher = chokidar.watch('file or dir', {ignored: /^\./, persistent: true});

watcher
  .on('add', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been added');})
  .on('change', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been changed');})
  .on('unlink', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been removed');})
  .on('error', function(error) {console.error('Error happened', error);})

// 'add' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second argument.
// http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', function(path, stats) {
  console.log('File', path, 'changed size to', stats.size);
});

watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3']);

// Only needed if watching is persistent.
watcher.close();
```

## API
* `chokidar.watch(paths, options)`: takes paths to be watched and options:
    * `options.ignored` (regexp or function) files to be ignored.
      This function or regexp is tested against the **whole path**,
      not just filename. Example:
    `chokidar.watch('file', {ignored: /^\./})`.
    * `options.persistent` (default: `false`). Indicates whether the process
    should continue to run as long as files are being watched.
    * `options.ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates
      whether to watch files that don't have read permissions or not.
    * `options.ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). Indicates whether chokidar
    should ignore initial `add` events or not.
    * `options.interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling.
    * `options.binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system 
    polling for binary files (see extensions in src/is-binary).
    * `options.usePolling` (default: `true`). Whether to use fs.watchFile 
    (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization, 
    consider setting this to `false`.

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(file / files)`: add directories / files for tracking.
Takes an array of strings (file paths) or just one path.
* `.on(event, callback)`: listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `change`, `unlink`, `error`.
Also, `all` is available which emitted for every `add`, `change` and `unlink`.
* `.close()`: remove all listeners from watched files.
