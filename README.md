# Chokidar
A neat wrapper around node.js fs.watch / fs.watchFile.

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm-dl/chokidar.png)](https://nodei.co/npm/chokidar/)

## Why?
Node.js `fs.watch`:

* Doesn't report filenames on OS X.
* Doesn't report events at all when using editors like Sublime on OS X.
* Doesn't use OS X internals for **fast low-CPU watching on OS X** (no other fs watch module does this!).
* Sometimes reports events twice.
* Has only one non-useful event: `rename`.
* Has [a lot of other issues](https://github.com/joyent/node/search?q=fs.watch&type=Issues)

Node.js `fs.watchFile`:

* Almost as shitty in event tracking.

Other node.js watching libraries:

* Are not using ultra-fast non-polling watcher implementation on OS X

Chokidar resolves these problems.

It is used in
[brunch](http://brunch.io),
[socketstream](http://www.socketstream.org),
and [karma](http://karma-runner.github.io)
and has proven itself in production environments.

## Getting started
Install chokidar via node.js package manager:

    npm install chokidar

Then just require the package in your code:

```javascript
var chokidar = require('chokidar');

var watcher = chokidar.watch('file or dir', {ignored: /[\/\\]\./, persistent: true});

watcher
  .on('add', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been added');})
  .on('addDir', function(path) {console.log('Directory', path, 'has been added');})
  .on('change', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been changed');})
  .on('unlink', function(path) {console.log('File', path, 'has been removed');})
  .on('unlinkDir', function(path) {console.log('Directory', path, 'has been removed');})
  .on('error', function(error) {console.error('Error happened', error);})

// 'add', 'addDir' and 'change' events also receive stat() results as second argument.
// http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats
watcher.on('change', function(path, stats) {
  console.log('File', path, 'changed size to', stats.size);
});

watcher.add('new-file');
watcher.add(['new-file-2', 'new-file-3']);

// Only needed if watching is persistent.
watcher.close();

// One-liner
require('chokidar').watch('.', {ignored: /[\/\\]\./}).on('all', function(event, path) {
  console.log(event, path);
});

```

## API
* `chokidar.watch(paths, options)`: takes paths to be watched recursively and options:
    * `options.ignored` (regexp or function) files to be ignored.
      This function or regexp is tested against the **whole path**,
      not just filename. If it is a function with two arguments, it gets called
      twice per path - once with a single argument (the path), second time with
      two arguments (the path and the [`fs.Stats`](http://nodejs.org/api/fs.html#fs_class_fs_stats)
      object of that path).
    * `options.persistent` (default: `false`). Indicates whether the process
    should continue to run as long as files are being watched.
    * `options.ignorePermissionErrors` (default: `false`). Indicates
      whether to watch files that don't have read permissions.
    * `options.ignoreInitial` (default: `false`). Indicates whether chokidar
    should ignore the initial `add` events or not.
    * `options.interval` (default: `100`). Interval of file system polling.
    * `options.binaryInterval` (default: `300`). Interval of file system
    polling for binary files (see extensions in src/is-binary).
    * `options.usePolling` (default: `false` on Windows, `true` on Linux and OS X). Whether to use fs.watchFile
    (backed by polling), or fs.watch. If polling leads to high CPU utilization,
    consider setting this to `false`.

`chokidar.watch()` produces an instance of `FSWatcher`. Methods of `FSWatcher`:

* `.add(file / files)`: Add directories / files for tracking.
Takes an array of strings (file paths) or just one path.
* `.on(event, callback)`: Listen for an FS event.
Available events: `add`, `change`, `unlink`, `error`.
Additionally `all` is available which gets emitted for every `add`, `change` and `unlink`.
* `.close()`: Removes all listeners from watched files.
